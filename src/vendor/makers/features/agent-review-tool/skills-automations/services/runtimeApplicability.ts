/**
 * Which questions an artifact kind can even be asked (spec 018).
 *
 * The review used to answer every question for every upload, and two of those
 * answers were false. A Scout automation `.json` was reported as "Runs, 100/100"
 * on Copilot Cowork and on Copilot Studio — neither of which has an import path
 * for an automation file at all. The score was 100 for the same reason it was
 * wrong: no finding names those runtimes, so `verdictFor` fell through to its
 * success branch. Absence of evidence was being printed as evidence of success.
 *
 * "Not applicable" and "Runs" are different answers, and only one of them is
 * true here. The same applies one level down, to the rubric: a bare automation
 * has no folder, no frontmatter and no second runtime, so two of the six
 * dimensions are asking about parts that do not exist.
 *
 * Everything in this file is a pure function of (kind, runtime) or (kind,
 * dimension). That matters because three callers must agree: the live review,
 * the store migration that repairs rows written before this existed, and the
 * tests. A rule that needed the upload itself could not repair history.
