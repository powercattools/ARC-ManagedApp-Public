/**
 * The view model behind the runtime metric cards.
 *
 * Split from `RuntimeMetrics.tsx` for the same reason `score.ts` is split from `ScoreCard.tsx`:
 * the test environment is `node`, so anything importing Fluent UI cannot be unit tested, and the
 * decision this file makes is the part worth testing.
 *
 * Named `runtimeSummary` rather than `runtimeMetrics` because a name differing from
 * `RuntimeMetrics.tsx` only in casing is the same path on Windows, and
 * `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` rejects the resulting collision.
