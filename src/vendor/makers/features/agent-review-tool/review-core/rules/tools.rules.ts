/**
 * The Tools pillar — one record and four checks over the captured tool inventory.
 *
 * Every rule here answers its question once per offending tool rather than once
 * per agent, which is why each failing branch returns `failWith` with a row per
 * component instead of a single agent-level verdict. The identity on each row is
 * taken verbatim from the capture (`componentIdUnique`, then `componentId`, then
 * the schema name) because a display name or an array position does not survive a
 * re-capture, and a row the host cannot tie back to a real component is reported
 * as unverifiable rather than silently trusted.
 *
 * Two relocation notes, both deliberate:
 *
 * - **TOL-01's not-applicable reason is new text.** The hand-written rule passed
 *   no reason at all. ART reaches the empty-inventory case through its
 *   `optionalPopulation` short-circuit, which answers before the check is ever
 *   called, so the string below is unreachable in ART and cannot move a byte of
 *   its output. It is written out anyway because `review-core` owes a reason on
 *   every not-applicable, and a host that calls `check` directly deserves one.
 * - **TOL-05's partial-inventory flag is published by the adapter.** A tool with
 *   no connector/operation pair makes the duplicate scope incomplete, and ART
 *   carries that as `CopilotInspection.incomplete`, which `RuleOutcome` does not
 *   model. {@link toolOperationScopeIncomplete} is exported so the adapter can
 *   re-publish it without the predicate being written down twice.
