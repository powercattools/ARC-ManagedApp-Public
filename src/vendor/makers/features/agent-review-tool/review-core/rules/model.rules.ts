/**
 * Model configuration — one rule, and it is a record.
 *
 * MDL-01 reports which model the agent was configured with. It never fails,
 * because "this agent uses GPT-4o" is not a finding; it is context the reviewer
 * needs in order to read every other finding. `severity: 'info'` is what makes
 * that expressible: the scorer excludes info rules from both sides of the ratio,
 * so a record is published without diluting the pillar it sits in.
 *
 * Its `pillar` is therefore inert — nothing reads it — but the field is required
 * and a lie is worse than an arbitrary truth, so it names the pillar the model
 * most affects. ART's own grouping is unchanged: the adapter still publishes
 * `family: 'Model'`, which is what the UI groups and what Dataverse has stored.
