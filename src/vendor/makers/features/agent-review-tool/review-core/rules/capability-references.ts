/**
 * Resolving capability names out of authored prose.
 *
 * Two rules ask the same mechanical question of different text — INS-09 of the
 * agent instructions, SKL-15 of each inline skill body — so the detector is
 * declared here once rather than copied into either family. It is a seam in the
 * same sense as `standard.ts`: shared algorithm, no rule of its own.
 *
 * The question it answers is deliberately narrow. Deciding whether a phrase
 * *means* a capability is a reading task and belongs to the AI rules that judge
 * the same text (INS-07, SKL-09). Deciding whether a name the author already
 * wrote in an invocation frame matches the captured inventory is not: it is a
 * string comparison, it costs nothing, and it still answers when the AI workflow
 * is unreachable.
