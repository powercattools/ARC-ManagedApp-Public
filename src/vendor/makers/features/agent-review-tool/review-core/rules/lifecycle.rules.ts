/**
 * Lifecycle context — two rules, and both are records.
 *
 * LCY-01 states which harness the agent runs on; LCY-02 states what it is made
 * of. Neither is a judgement: "this agent has three tools" is not a finding, it
 * is the context a reviewer needs in order to read every other finding.
 * `severity: 'info'` is what makes that expressible — the scorer excludes info
 * rules from both sides of the ratio, so a record is published without diluting
 * the pillar it sits in.
 *
 * Their `pillar` is therefore inert — nothing reads it — but the field is
 * required and there is no Lifecycle pillar to name: `AGENT_PILLAR_WEIGHTS` sums
 * to exactly 100 across six pillars and a seventh would break that arithmetic.
 * `orchestration` is the pillar these facts most describe. ART's own grouping is
 * unchanged: the adapter still publishes `family: 'Lifecycle'`, which is what the
 * UI groups by and what Dataverse has stored.
 *
 * Both rules carry a per-instance `why` that is narrower than the rule's own —
 * the rule-level `why` explains why the record exists at all, the instance's
 * explains what the recorded fact means. That split is what the hand-written
 * findings already published, so it is preserved rather than reconciled.
