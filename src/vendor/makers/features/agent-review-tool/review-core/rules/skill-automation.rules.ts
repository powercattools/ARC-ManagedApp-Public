/**
 * The deterministic rules over a Scout automation definition shipped in a skill
 * bundle (Group E of the legacy `RULE_REGISTRY`).
 *
 * A sibling of `skill-packaging.rules.ts`, not a second seam. It imports that
 * file's generator, its population vocabulary and its entry shape, and adds
 * exactly two things of its own: the population these four rules share, and a
 * way to keep a legacy `dimension` that its `pillar` does not derive.
 *
 * ── Why the dimension override exists ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `skillPackagingRule` derives the published `dimension` from the declared
 * `pillar` via `SKILL_DIMENSION_BUCKET`, which is right for the packaging rules
 * because for all of them the two agree. For three of the four rules here they
 * do not, and both sides are load-bearing:
 *
 * - The **pillar** is what the rubric scorer reads, and for `AUTO-UNATTENDED`
 *   and `AUTO-DESTRUCTIVE` it is pinned by `RULE_TO_DIMENSION` in
 *   `skills-automations/services/artifactReviewService.ts` and asserted by
 *   `skills-automations/__tests__/reviewPipeline.test.ts`
 *   (`dimensionForFinding('AUTO-UNATTENDED') === 'safety-evidence'`).
 * - The **dimension** is the legacy four-bucket grouping key that
 *   `createRegisteredFinding` copies onto every finding, and it branches on
 *   `dimension === 'safety'`. Deriving `AUTO-UNATTENDED`'s dimension from its
 *   pinned pillar would turn `'readiness'` into `'safety'` and start emitting a
 *   blocking safety disposition this rule has never emitted.
 *
 * So they cannot derive from one another, and D-13 fidelity says a relocation
 * does not change published data. `SkillPackagingOptions.legacyDimension` declares
 * the pillar truthfully and overlays the legacy dimension on the projected row
 * only, leaving `rule.pillar` untouched. Every overlay is marked `// DIVERGENCE:` at
 * its declaration with both values, so the list of rows whose two axes disagree
 * is readable rather than inferred. None of them is "fixed" here; closing them
 * is a scoring change and belongs to a phase that is allowed to move scores.
 *
 * ── Why the population is "is there an automation at all" ───────────────────
 *
 * All four rules make a claim *about an automation definition*. A skill bundle
 * that ships none has no claim to answer, so these rules are not-applicable
 * rather than passing: a pass would credit the bundle for four questions it was
 * never asked and dilute every real result beside it. The partner hazard is the
 * opposite one — a bundle whose only candidate JSON could not be parsed has not
 * been shown to contain no automation, it has not been read — and that is
 * `could-not-run`, never not-applicable.
