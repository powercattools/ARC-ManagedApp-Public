/**
 * The 15 Standard-harness instruction-compliance rules.
 *
 * These are the oldest rules in the product and the last to reach a registry.
 * They are declared in `contracts/Constants.ts` as `COMPLIANCE_CRITERIA`,
 * projected into workflow templates by `STANDARD_INSTRUCTION_WORKFLOW_RULES`,
 * composed into the `standard` AI node contract by `ai-nodes/catalog.ts`, and
 * parsed back out by `parseInstructionRuleResults` — four files, no registry
 * entry. The scorer therefore reached them only through the legacy
 * `FAMILY_TO_PILLAR` table, which resolves the hardcoded `family: 'Instructions'`
 * that the parser stamps on every one of them.
 *
 * That is exactly the lookup Phase 3 replaces with `ruleById(...)?.pillar`, so
 * without this file all 15 would leave the Instructions denominator the moment
 * the swap landed — silently, because an unresolved id is dropped rather than
 * failed. They are real, current, maintained rules: every new Standard review
 * emits all 15, so this is not legacy drift to be tolerated with a fallback.
 *
 * **Severity.** The criteria grade themselves `High | Medium | Low`, and this
 * vocabulary has no `low`. That is not a loss: `parseInstructionRuleResults`
 * already collapses the three to two, mapping `High` to `error` and *both*
 * `Medium` and `Low` to `warning`. `Low` therefore becomes `medium` here, whose
 * `severityCredit` is 0.5 — the same credit the legacy `CREDIT` table gave a
 * `warning`. Registering these moves no Standard score.
 *
 * **Tags are the catalog's, unioned with what was already here.** `tags` is a
 * closed list, and the six subject-axis words the AI catalog uses — `routing`,
 * `scope`, `ux`, `grounding`, `capability-alignment`, `dependencies` — were not
 * members, so an earlier pass dropped them and left six rules with `[]`. They
 * are members now, and each rule carries the union of the two sets: nothing the
 * catalog knew is lost, and nothing this file knew is either. Three rules
 * therefore keep a `safety` tag the catalog does not carry.
 *
 * **Prose is reproduced, not rewritten.** `why` and `fix` are the existing
 * `description` and `INSTRUCTION_ACTIONS` strings verbatim so that registering a
 * rule cannot change what a maker reads. Rewriting them is owned separately.
 *
 * **Not every criterion is an instruction rule.** All 15 arrive from one
 * instruction-compliance file, so registering them as `instructions` wholesale
 * was a provenance artefact rather than a judgement. Five ask about something
 * else and declare their own `pillar`:
 *
 * - `tool-routing-hints` and `escalation-guidance` ask who owns a request and
 *   where it goes when this agent cannot serve it. That is **orchestration**.
 * - `citations-and-sources`, `link-safety` and `accuracy-quality` ask what the
 *   agent may present as sourced fact. That is **knowledge** — and the Standard
 *   harness has *no* deterministic knowledge rules at all, because `KNW-01`
 *   through `KNW-04` are all `harnesses: COPILOT`. Its 8-point pillar scored
 *   `null` and was dropped from every composite. These three are its entire
 *   subject.
 *
 * `accuracy-quality` was briefly registered as `instructions`, on the argument
 * that forbidding fabrication is a property of the instruction text. Its own
 * `why` and `fix` say otherwise — they speak of grounding the agent in knowledge
 * sources and requiring grounded evidence — and the AI catalog, which is what
 * actually scores it today, always read it as knowledge. The catalog's reading
 * wins, so this file now agrees with both the catalog and the rule's own words.
