/**
 * Connected agents — two rules: one check and one record.
 *
 * CON-03 asks whether each connected agent says *when* the primary agent should
 * delegate to it, and answers once per offending agent: one rule, many rows. The
 * fifteen-character floor is the base-rule threshold ART has always applied, kept
 * verbatim rather than re-reasoned, because a relocation that moves a threshold
 * silently rescores every agent that sat near it.
 *
 * CON-04 is a record. "This agent delegates to three others, two of which receive
 * conversation history" is context a reviewer needs in order to read CON-03's
 * answer, not a verdict of its own, so it is `severity: 'info'` and the scorer
 * excludes it from both sides of the ratio.
 *
 * Neither rule decides what happens when no connected agents were captured at
 * all. That is ART's availability cascade — an empty optional population is
 * not-applicable when the capture was complete and could-not-run when it was not
 * — and it stays in the adapter (`optionalPopulation: 'connectedAgents'`) rather
 * than being re-derived here, because "no connected agents" and "we could not
 * read the connected agents" are not the same answer and only the host knows
 * which one it is holding.
