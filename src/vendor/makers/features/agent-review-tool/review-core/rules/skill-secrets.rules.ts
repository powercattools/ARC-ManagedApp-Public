/**
 * The deterministic secret and private-data rules over an uploaded skill's
 * bundle — group C of `skillRuleRegistry.ts`.
 *
 * Same move, and the same machinery, as `skill-packaging.rules.ts`: the
 * declaration below is the one authority, and {@link skillPackagingRule}
 * projects it into the `Rule` the core registry wants and into the legacy
 * `SkillRuleDefinition` row `createRegisteredFinding` has always read. Nothing
 * here restates a value the seam already derives, and the detector is not
 * re-run — `secretScanner.ts` is what decides a failure, and these rules report
 * a verdict over the findings it already produced.
 *
 * These six are one family by population as well as by subject. Every one of
 * them is answered by the same pass over the same set: `scanForSecrets` walks
 * `artifact.files`, skips anything binary or undecoded, and runs every detector
 * against the text of what is left. So they share one
 * {@link DECODED_BUNDLE_TEXT} population rather than declaring six copies of it,
 * and they publish under the `Security` family rather than the seam's
 * `Packaging` constant — which is exactly why `family` rides on the options.
 *
 * Two judgements are worth stating, because both move scores:
 *
 * - **The empty set of matches is a pass, not a not-applicable.** These are
 *   scanning rules, and the claim each makes is "the bundle holds none of this".
 *   A readable bundle with no credential in it has answered that question
 *   affirmatively; it has not escaped being asked. This is LIM-SIZE's reading of
 *   a budget rather than PKG-NAME's reading of a missing field, and returning
 *   not-applicable here would drop all six from both sides of `creditFor`, so a
 *   clean bundle would earn nothing at all on safety evidence.
 * - **An unscannable bundle is `could-not-run`, never not-applicable.** Both
 *   degenerate states — an archive that produced no file table, and a bundle
 *   whose every file is binary or failed to decode — mean the scan did not
 *   happen. Nothing was measured, and a claim of absence cannot be earned by a
 *   measurement that was never taken. Unlike the packaging rules, none of these
 *   has a *genuine* not-applicable: there is no runtime gate on a secret, and no
 *   sibling presence rule owns the absence, so `notApplicableWhen` is empty by
 *   construction rather than by omission.
 *
 * The population object is declared here rather than in the seam because it is
 * read only by this file; `skill-packaging.rules.ts` is imported from and never
 * edited.
