/**
 * The deterministic packaging rules over an uploaded skill's bundle.
 *
 * These are the second class of `standalone-skill` metadata rules moving out of
 * `agents-experience/services/skill/skillRuleRegistry.ts`. The architecture is
 * the one `skill-scanner.rules.ts` proved: one declaration, projected two ways —
 * `rule` is the shape the core registry wants, `definition` is the legacy
 * `SkillRuleDefinition` row `createRegisteredFinding` has always read — and a
 * generated `check` that reports a verdict over findings the detector already
 * produced rather than re-running detection.
 *
 * Three things differ from the scanner seam, and each is a deliberate sibling
 * rather than a change to it:
 *
 * - **The context is the bundle, not a resource list.** These rules read the
 *   manifest, the file table and the selected runtimes — `UploadedArtifact` and
 *   `TargetRuntime[]` — none of which is a `SkillBundleResource`. So
 *   {@link SkillPackagingContext} sits beside `SkillResourceContext` instead of
 *   widening it. `runtimes` is part of the context because it is part of the
 *   question: the Cowork limits are a Cowork upload contract, and a reviewer who
 *   did not select Cowork was never asked about them.
 * - **The population is resolved, not filtered.** `SkillScannerPopulation` is a
 *   per-resource predicate, which cannot express "the frontmatter `name` field"
 *   or "the bundle as a whole". {@link SkillPackagingPopulation} returns the
 *   ladder state directly, so the generator stays one shared reduction while
 *   each rule says, in its own terms, what "there is nothing to look at" and
 *   "it could not be read" mean for it.
 * - **`family` is per-rule.** The scanner seam hardcodes `'Skills'` because all
 *   21 of its rules publish under it. These 29 span five families — Packaging,
 *   Security, Skills, Automation and Runtime — so the family rides on the
 *   options beside the other two legacy scales.
 *
 * The important call, and the one that changes scores if it is got wrong, is
 * which bundle states are `not-applicable`. The answer is that a rule's
 * population is **what its claim is about, not what it reads**:
 *
 * - A *presence* rule — PKG-REQ, PKG-FM — claims something about the bundle,
 *   which always exists. It can never be not-applicable for a missing manifest,
 *   because that absence is precisely its failure. Returning not-applicable
 *   there drops it from both sides of the ratio in `creditFor`, so a bundle with
 *   no SKILL.md at all would score the same on packaging as a perfect one.
 * - A *property* rule — PKG-NAME below — claims something about a field. With no
 *   field there is no claim to judge, and the absence is already owned and
 *   reported by the presence rule. `evaluatePackaging` encodes the same
 *   judgement by returning early rather than re-reporting one defect as several,
 *   so mirroring it here is not-applicable, not a second failure.
 * - A *limit* rule — LIM-SIZE below — claims a budget is not exceeded. The empty
 *   set satisfies that, so no companion files is a **pass**. Its genuine
 *   not-applicable is the runtime gate, which is the condition under which the
 *   detector does not run at all.
