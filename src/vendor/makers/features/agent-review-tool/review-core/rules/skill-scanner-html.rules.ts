/**
 * The deterministic scanner rules over an uploaded skill's HTML resources.
 *
 * Same move as `skill-scanner.rules.ts`, continued: these nine rows used to be
 * hand-written metadata in `agents-experience/services/skill/skillRuleRegistry.ts`
 * with no `check`, and the detection lived in `resourceScanners.ts`. The
 * declaration below is now the one authority, projected into the `RuleOutcome`
 * shape the core registry wants and into the legacy `SkillRuleDefinition` shape
 * `createRegisteredFinding` has always read.
 *
 * They are split into their own file rather than appended to the Python rules
 * because the three populations `scanSkillResource` dispatches on are the natural
 * seam, not because an HTML rule is a different kind of thing — every rule here
 * is built by the same {@link skillScannerRule} and shares its generated check.
 *
 * Two things worth knowing before reading the prose:
 *
 * - **`passWhen` and `failWhen` describe the scanner, not the hazard.** Several
 *   of these rules have a classifier that suppresses a match the regex found —
 *   an archived `references/snapshot` path is never reported, a literal-valued
 *   `innerHTML` assignment is not a sink, and `HTML-SCRIPT-01` defers to whatever
 *   more specific inline-script rule fired on the same file. Prose that promised
 *   a failure the detector will not raise would be worse than no prose.
 * - **`dimension` is absent on purpose.** All nine legacy rows carry
 *   `dimension: "safety"`, and `safety-evidence` is the only skill dimension that
 *   buckets there, so the pillar below derives the legacy value rather than
 *   restating it.
