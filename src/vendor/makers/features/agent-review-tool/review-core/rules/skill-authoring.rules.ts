/**
 * The deterministic authoring rules for one skill inside a Copilot agent.
 *
 * These nine rules were inline logic *and* inline prose in
 * `agents-experience/services/skill/L0SkillAnalyzer.ts`: the title, the fact, the
 * reason and the fix were string literals in the emitting code, and the ids were
 * in no registry at all. Unregistered, they reached a pillar only through
 * `FAMILY_TO_PILLAR` in `agents-experience/services/scoring.ts` — the table that
 * cannot be deleted while any id resolves through it.
 *
 * **One authority, two shapes (IMPL-12).** The legacy evaluation is not
 * re-expressed once per rule here. `analyzeSkillL0`'s body is hoisted verbatim
 * into {@link assessSkillAuthoring}, which returns one verdict per rule, and that
 * single assessment is projected twice: each rule's `check` reads its own verdict
 * for the scorer, and `L0SkillAnalyzer` reads the same verdicts to rebuild the
 * `GroundedFinding[]` and `RuleEvaluationResult[]` it has always published. The
 * regexes, the thresholds and every literal string below are the ones that were
 * in the analyzer; none of them were harmonised on the way across.
 *
 * Three things worth knowing before reading the rules:
 *
 * - **The harness is `copilot`, not `copilot-skill`.** The subject really is one
 *   skill, and `subjectScope` says so — but the only consumer that *scores* these
 *   ids is `CopilotReviewService`, which reviews a Copilot agent and rolls each
 *   skill's rule results into that agent's Skills pillar. `copilot-skill` is the
 *   AI-node harness and is deliberately still empty at Step 2.3 (D-2.3-K is the
 *   open question); claiming it here would answer that question by accident.
 *   `pillar: 'skills'` reproduces `FAMILY_TO_PILLAR['Skills']` exactly, so no id
 *   moves.
 *
 * - **Four of the nine can be not-applicable, and five can never be.** SKL-01,
 *   SKL-02 and SKL-03 ask whether something exists at all, so a missing name,
 *   description or body *is* the failure — `notApplicableWhen` is empty on
 *   purpose, not unfinished. SKL-05 scans a markdown string that is always
 *   present. SKL-07, SKL-11, SKL-12, SKL-13 and SKL-14 are property rules about a
 *   body or a description, and report not-applicable when their subject is absent
 *   rather than handing out a free pass over an empty population.
 *
 * - **SKL-05 is the one rule with two failure costs.** Legacy status was
 *   three-valued — `error` when a blocking directive was found, `warning` for an
 *   advisory, `passed` for a clean scan — against a `CREDIT` table of
 *   `{ error: 0, warning: 0.5, passed: 1 }`. `Rule.severity` is one value, so the
 *   rule is declared `high` (a blocking failure earns nothing) and the advisory
 *   case returns `failPartial(…, 0.5)`, which is what the legacy half-credit was.
 *
 * **Deliberately not here: SKL-05's finding.** `L0SkillAnalyzer` publishes a
 * *status* for SKL-05 and no finding; the `GroundedFinding` is assembled by
 * `skl05FromSafety` in `CopilotReviewService.ts`, outside this analyzer and
 * outside this migration. SKL-05's verdict therefore carries no instance, which
 * is what keeps `frontmatterFindings` byte-identical.
