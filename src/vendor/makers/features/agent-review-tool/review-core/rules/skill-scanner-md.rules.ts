/**
 * The deterministic scanner rules over an uploaded skill's Markdown and text
 * resources.
 *
 * Same move as `skill-scanner.rules.ts`, which owns the shared machinery and the
 * Python family: the declaration below is the one authority, and
 * {@link skillScannerRule} projects it into the `Rule` the core registry wants
 * and the legacy `SkillRuleDefinition` row `createRegisteredFinding` has always
 * read. Nothing here re-states a value the exemplar already derives.
 *
 * These five are one family by subject as well as by population: every one of
 * them is a prompt-injection surface that arrives as prose. A Markdown resource
 * is read by the model, not executed, so the attack is not a dangerous call but
 * a dangerous *sentence* — an override directive, a hidden comment, a beacon
 * URL, an execution order, a forged signature. The detectors live in
 * `resourceScanners.ts` (`MARKDOWN_PATTERNS`), and the `passWhen`/`failWhen`
 * prose below describes those patterns rather than the risk in the abstract, so
 * a maker reading a pass knows what was actually looked for.
