/**
 * The remaining Python `SCR-*` scanner rules, declared the way `SCR-CMD-01` is.
 *
 * Same move, same shape, different file: these six used to exist only as rows in
 * `agents-experience/services/skill/skillRuleRegistry.ts`, and they now declare
 * themselves once here and project into both the core `Rule` vocabulary and the
 * legacy `SkillRuleDefinition` row `createRegisteredFinding` reads. Everything
 * that makes a scanner rule a scanner rule — the population gate, the reduction
 * over scanner output, the `harnesses`/`subjectScope`/`execution` triple, the
 * derivation of the legacy row — lives in {@link skillScannerRule} and is
 * imported rather than restated.
 *
 * They live beside `skill-scanner.rules.ts` rather than inside it because the
 * 53 do not all land at once and a single file edited by several hands at once
 * is a merge conflict waiting to happen. The split is physical only: the entries
 * are the same type, carry the same contract, and are concatenated at
 * registration.
 *
 * All six are Python security rules whose legacy `dimension` was `"safety"`, so
 * all six declare `pillar: 'safety-evidence'` — the one skill dimension that
 * buckets to `safety` in `SKILL_DIMENSION_BUCKET`. The `why`, `recommendation`,
 * ordered `fixSteps` and `referenceIds` are carried across byte for byte; only
 * the prose the new vocabulary adds — question, summary, passWhen, failWhen,
 * notApplicableWhen — is authored here, and it is written from the actual
 * patterns and classifiers in `resourceScanners.ts` so it describes what the
 * scanner detects rather than what the rule's name suggests.
