/**
 * The Instructions pillar — four rules over the instruction text.
 *
 * These moved out of `agents-experience/services/rules/instructionRules.ts`,
 * which is now a publication adapter. The forty-character threshold and the
 * citation heuristic are the same predicates over the same field, declared once
 * here. INS-07 no longer carries a predicate at all: it is an AI rule, and the
 * mechanical half of the named-capability detector it used to run is declared
 * separately as INS-09 rather than left inside it.
 *
 * All four read `agentSettings.instructions` — INS-09 also reads the capability
 * inventory — but they are separate rules rather than one with four branches
 * because they fail for different reasons, cite different evidence and are
 * scored independently. INS-08 and INS-09 opt out when the text is empty rather
 * than piling a second failure on an agent that already failed INS-01.

/**
 * The named-capability detector INS-07 used to carry, restored under its own id.
 *
 * INS-07 became an AI rule because deciding whether a phrase *means* a capability
 * is a reading task. The mechanical half of that question is not: an instruction
 * that names a capability in quotes, backticks or Title Case, in a "use the X
 * tool" frame, either matches the captured inventory or it does not. That half is
 * cheap, runs with no workflow, and survives the workflow being unreachable.
 *
 * The detector itself lives in `capability-references.ts` because SKL-15 asks the
 * same question of skill bodies, and the two must not drift apart.
 *
 * It is `medium` rather than `high` on purpose. INS-07 judges the same text from
 * the other side, so a stop-list miss here must not cost the pillar twice.
