/**
 * The runtime-awareness rules (spec 018, group F) over an uploaded skill.
 *
 * These are the third class of `standalone-skill` metadata rules moving out of
 * `agents-experience/services/skill/skillRuleRegistry.ts`, and they sit on the
 * seam `skill-packaging.rules.ts` established: one declaration, projected two
 * ways — `rule` is the shape the core registry wants, `definition` is the legacy
 * `SkillRuleDefinition` row `createRegisteredFinding` has always read.
 *
 * They reuse that seam's context, options, population and — crucially — its
 * `definition` projection unchanged. What they deliberately do **not** reuse is
 * its generated check, and the rest of this comment is why.
 *
 * ── These four rules are AI rules, not deterministic ones ──────────────────
 *
 * Each asks the same question: does this skill actually *depend* on the thing it
 * mentions? A skill that says "unlike browser-based tools, this uses Graph"
 * mentions browser automation without depending on it. Telling a dependency
 * apart from a mention is a reading task, so the verdict belongs to the
 * `standalone-skill` node and not to a scanner here.
 *
 * These rules therefore declare `execution: 'ai'` and carry **no `check`** —
 * the registry's invariant for an AI rule (`registry.ts:197`). {@link
 * skillRuntimeRule} sets that over the `'deterministic'` the seam fills in, and
 * `nodesFor` consequently routes all four to the `standalone-skill` node, which
 * is handed each rule's full contract — title, question, pass/fail clauses, fix
 * and references — from the `definition` rows below. One authority for the
 * wording, one place that reaches a verdict.
 *
 * ── Why there is no deterministic half ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There used to be one. `skills-automations/services/runtimeRules.ts` scanned
 * for these four and emitted every hit as a *candidate* — `source: 'hybrid'`,
 * `pendingConfirmation: true`, severity stepped down — which the AI layer was
 * then asked to confirm. That third mode is gone, and the scanner with it. It
 * could not survive contact with the rest of the model for three reasons, each
 * of which is worth keeping on record because they are the reasons not to
 * reintroduce it:
 *
 * 1. **A candidate is not a verdict.** `packagingCheck` reduces
 *    `hits.length > 0` straight to `failWith(...)`, which would promote an
 *    unconfirmed mention into a confirmed blocker. Avoiding that cost the
 *    scoring path a parallel weighting rule and the release gates a parallel
 *    exclusion — three subsystems carrying one flag.
 * 2. **Severity was stepped per target runtime, not per rule.** One finding per
 *    selected runtime, each with its own staleness- and provenance-stepped
 *    severity. `RuleOutcome` carries one verdict and `Rule.severity` one
 *    severity, so N stepped severities collapsed onto the strongest.
 * 3. **The context could not see the flag.** `SkillPackagingContext` types its
 *    findings as `GroundedSkillFinding`; `pendingConfirmation`, `source` and
 *    `runtimes` are declared on `ArtifactFinding`, which extends it. A faithful
 *    check could only recover them with an unchecked cast.
 *
 * Routing the question to the node that can answer it removes all three at
 * once, and leaves one way for a rule to be answered deterministically and one
 * way for it to be answered by a model.
