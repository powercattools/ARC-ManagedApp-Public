/**
 * The deterministic authoring-shape rules over an uploaded skill's SKILL.md.
 *
 * The third class of `standalone-skill` metadata rules moving out of
 * `agents-experience/services/skill/skillRuleRegistry.ts`, and the first to ride
 * on the packaging seam rather than beside it: these rules read the same
 * `UploadedArtifact` that `skill-packaging.rules.ts` reads, so they reuse
 * {@link skillPackagingRule} and its context wholesale instead of declaring a
 * third builder that would differ from it only in which file it lives in.
 *
 * What is different is the *population*, and that is the whole reason for a
 * separate file. The packaging rules resolve a frontmatter field or a file table
 * under a runtime gate; these resolve the markdown body — so the population is
 * declared here, next to the rules that depend on it, rather than added to the
 * seam.
 *
 * Three things worth knowing before reading the rules:
 *
 * - **`dimension` is absent on purpose.** All three legacy rows carry
 *   `dimension: "quality"`, and `trigger-clarity`, `task-focus` and
 *   `instruction-quality` all bucket there, so the pillar below derives the
 *   legacy value rather than restating it. There is no divergence to record:
 *   `SKILL_DIMENSION_BUCKET` reproduces each legacy `dimension` exactly.
 * - **The pillars are not one per prefix.** `artifactReviewService.ts` maps the
 *   `SHP` prefix to `trigger-clarity` and then overrides two of the three rules
 *   —  SHP-BODYLEN to `task-focus`, SHP-STEPS to `instruction-quality`. The
 *   override table is the published answer, so it is what the `pillar` fields
 *   below say; `reviewPipeline.test.ts` pins the first two of them.
 * - **Legacy `low` carries as `info`.** `Rule.severity` has three values and
 *   cannot spell the five-point artifact scale. `critical`/`high` fold to
 *   `high`, `medium` stays, and `low` folds to `info` — which is correct for
 *   what these two rules are, published authoring advice rather than a defect,
 *   but it does mean the new scorer excludes them from both sides of the ratio.
 *   The legacy string rides on the options, so the projected row still reads
 *   `"low"` byte for byte.
 *
 * **Deliberately not here: SHP-HEADINGS.** It is published in `RULE_REGISTRY`
 * between SHP-BODYLEN and SHP-STEPS, but no scanner emits it — `shapeRules.ts`
 * has detectors for exactly the three below. A rule with no detector cannot be
 * given the generated check these share, because that check reports a verdict
 * over findings a detector already produced and would read every skill as a
 * pass. It stays with the orchestrator.

/**
 * How far SKILL.md could be split into frontmatter and body.
 *
 * `parseFrontmatter` is the detector's own, imported rather than reimplemented,
 * for the reason the packaging seam gives: a second markdown splitter here could
 * disagree with the one that produced the finding the maker is reading.
 *
 * A file with *no* frontmatter block is `read`, not a failure state. That is not
 * leniency — `parseFrontmatter` returns the whole document as the body in that
 * case, and `evaluateShape` goes on to measure it, so the body genuinely was
 * read. Only a block that is present and broken leaves the split undone, and the
 * missing-block case is already owned and reported by PKG-FM.

/**
 * The markdown body of SKILL.md.
 *
 * Every rule here makes a claim about the shape of what an author wrote — that
 * the description says when to reach for the skill, that the body stays inside
 * the Cowork word budget, that a procedure is numbered. With no body, none of
 * those claims has a subject, so the honest answer is not-applicable rather than
 * a pass: crediting a bundle with no SKILL.md for well-shaped prose would let an
 * empty upload score as a well-authored one.
 *
 * The three non-present states are kept apart because only one of them is
 * silence:
 *
 * - *Missing* and *unparsable* are absences. Each is already somebody's failure
 *   — PKG-REQ owns the first, PKG-FM the second — and re-reporting one defect as
 *   four is what the packaging seam's property rules exist not to do.
 * - *Undecodable* is not an absence. There is a SKILL.md and it could not be
 *   read, which is an infrastructure status and never a judgement about the
 *   skill, so it is `could-not-run`.
 * - An *empty* body is the genuine "nothing to look at": the frontmatter parsed,
 *   the file was read, and the author wrote no prose, no procedure and no
 *   structure for these rules to have an opinion about.
