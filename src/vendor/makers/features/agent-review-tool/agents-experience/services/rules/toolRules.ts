/**
 * TOL-05 is the one rule in this family that reports on the completeness of its own scope.
 *
 * A tool captured without a connector/operation pair cannot be compared against the
 * others, so the duplicate search covers less than the inventory and the assessment has
 * always said so through `incomplete`. A `RuleOutcome` has no way to express "answered,
 * but over part of the population" — `could-not-run` is the whole-rule version of that
 * and would change the outcome — so the flag is re-published here instead, from the same
 * predicate the rule itself skips on. Only ever raised, never cleared: everything ART
 * already folds into `incomplete` (partial populations, unverified evidence) stays.
 *
 * This deliberately stays a wrapper rather than becoming a `CoreCopilotOptions` hook
 * alongside `evidence`. A hook would raise the flag *inside* `defineCopilotRule`, where
 * `outcome === 'pass' && inspection.incomplete` is rewritten to `could-not-run` — and an
 * agent with three tools, one missing an `operationId` and no duplicates among the rest,
 * passes TOL-05 with an incomplete scope. That is an ordinary configuration, and turning
 * it into `could-not-run` would drop the rule out of the scoring denominator entirely.
 * Applying the flag after `evaluate` keeps `pass` + `incomplete: true`, which is what ART
 * has always published. Revisit in Phase 3, where the scorer, not the adapter, decides
 * what a partially-scoped pass is worth.
