/**
 * Legacy projections for the `skill-coverage` family.
 *
 * The rules in `review-core/rules/skill-coverage.rules` own the verdicts. These
 * adapters own nothing but the shape: they take the rows those rules produced
 * and emit the exact `GroundedFinding`s `CopilotReviewService` has always
 * emitted, byte for byte. Nothing here re-derives a verdict.
 *
 * One function is a deliberate exception to the second half of that rule.
 * {@link instructionCoverageRuleResults} *does* add `RuleEvaluationResult`s,
 * because `INS-02`…`INS-07` produced findings and no rows at all, so the scorer
 * never saw them and setting one aside moved nothing. It still re-derives no
 * verdict — it projects the same assessment functions the findings read.
 *
 * Three legacy-only details live here rather than on the rules, because `Rule`
 * cannot express them and bending it to would change what the rules mean:
 *   - `AEX-01` is `severity: 'info'` as a rule (it scores nothing, by D-2.3-I)
 *     but has always rendered as a `warning` finding, so the finding severity is
 *     written literally here.
 *   - `SKL-06` varies its finding severity per conflict from an AI-supplied
 *     field; a `Rule` carries one severity for the whole claim.
 *   - The "covers all five documented elements" positive is emitted under the
 *     id `INS-02`, which the element rule for `role` also uses. See below.

 * nothing, because there was no row to credit.
 *
 * It re-derives no verdict. Every status here is a projection of the same
 * assessment functions the findings read, and those already refuse to report a
 * pass for a classifier that did not run. **That is what keeps a review
 * scoreable when the AI workflow is unreachable:** they answer `could-not-run`,

 * row from *both* sides of the ratio. The deterministic rules alone then decide
 * the score, and dismissal keeps working exactly as it did. No AI rule can be
 * credited for a run that never happened.
 *
 * Iterating {@link INSTRUCTION_COVERAGE_RULES} rather than
 * `assessment.elements` is load-bearing. An element the validator dropped as
 * malformed or fabricated is absent from `elements`, and that is precisely the
 * case `assessInstructionElement` answers `could-not-run` for; iterating the
 * elements would omit the row instead, and an omitted row reads as a pass.
 *
 * The aggregate "covers all five" positive that `instructionCoverageFindings`
 * publishes under `INS-02` is a *finding*, not a row, so it does not collide
 * with the `INS-02` row here. Anything that later derives rows from findings by
 * id would double-count it.
