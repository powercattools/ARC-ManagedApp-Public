/**
 * Central rule registry for agent-level cross-skill orchestration findings
 * (Spec 013 P2-O). These are set-level checks whose unit of analysis is the
 * whole skill set (overlap, redundancy, contradiction, coverage gaps, coupling,
 * consistency) rather than a single skill, so they are surfaced in the dedicated
 * orchestration section instead of one of the four per-skill rubric dimensions.
 *
 * As with {@link ./skillRuleRegistry}, the registry is the single source of
 * truth for titles, why-explanations, ordered fix steps, and approved reference
 * IDs. The P2-O validator merges AI-supplied evidence with these deterministic
 * fields so all client-visible copy is grounded here, never in raw model output.
 *
 * That copy is no longer authored here. The six XSK rules are unified `Rule`s in
 * {@link ../../../review-core/rules/cross-skill.rules}, and this module is the
 * adapter that projects them back into the legacy definition shape, so each rule
 * is written exactly once. Only `type` and `confidence`, which the unified model
 * does not carry, are still declared below.
