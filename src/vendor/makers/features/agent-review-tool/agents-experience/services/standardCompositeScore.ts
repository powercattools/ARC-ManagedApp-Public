/**
 * standardCompositeScore
 *
 * The standard harness' headline score, computed by the same scorer the copilot harness uses.
 *
 * Until this existed a standard agent's overall score was the mean of two numbers produced by a
 * rubric of its own — `calculateAssessedScores`, which weighs severity points — while a copilot
 * agent's came from six weighted pillars graded off the rule registry. The same agent could not be
 * compared across the two, and a rule added to the registry changed one tool's score and not the
 * other's. This assembles the four inputs `computeGroundedScore` needs and calls it, so "one
 * scorer" is literally true rather than a convention.
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything a rule could decide. The pillar weights come from the registry, the
 * pillar of each row comes from the rule that produced it, and the credit arithmetic is
 * `scoring.ts`'s. What this file owns is only the mapping from a finished standard review onto
 * `GroundedScoreInput`.
 *
 * `findings` is deliberately empty. It is read by exactly one thing — the legacy
 * `deriveEvaluationSignals` shim used when re-scoring a saved review that has no model — and the
 * live path reads the model instead. Passing the standard review's patterns here would not add
 * evidence; it would resurrect the circular dependency where EVL-04's previous output decided
 * EVL-04's next input.

 * The composite, unless the only pillar left standing is the one that needs no review.

 * Evaluation is the one pillar that holds its full 30 points whether or not anything else was
 * measured (`UNCONDITIONAL_AGENT_PILLARS`), and it is scored from the agent's own components, so it
 * produces a number even when the AI assessment returned nothing usable. When every other pillar
 * comes back without a verdict, `compositeFromBreakdown` has no conditional weight left to
 * renormalize against and simply publishes the Evaluation pillar as the whole score — a standard
 * agent whose workflow returned a bare result would be stamped 0 as though it had been examined and
 * failed, which is the manufactured-score behaviour this refactor exists to remove.
 *
 * "This agent has no tests" is a true statement about one pillar, not a grade for six. So the
 * number is withheld rather than reshaped: the shared arithmetic stays exactly as the copilot
 * harness and the golden master pin it. `patternScore` and `instructionScore` are still persisted,
 * so whatever the run did observe survives; only the claim to a whole-agent score is dropped.
 *
 * To revert to publishing the Evaluation-only number, return `computeGroundedScore(input)`.
